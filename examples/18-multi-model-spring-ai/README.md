# Multi Model Spring AI

## Exercise

Using Spring Boot starters forces you to use a single model for your application. In this lab, you will create a multi-model Spring Boot application that uses both the OpenAI and Ollama AI models.

Create a new Spring Boot application that uses the OpenAI model to generate text and the Ollama AI model to translate the text into Spanish. As a next step you could create audio or even image.

You could use the Open Web UI to manage downloading the Google Gemma model `gemma2:2b`. Or you could have installed Ollama locally.

Have fun!

PS: Multi Modality is also mentioned in the documentation: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/multimodality.html>
