# Calling OpenAI Text to Speech from Spring AI

## Exploring the Speech Model Abstraction

1. Check the source files (Java, properties and POM).
2. The `SpeechModel` allows us to dynamically configure the API call. Many (default) parameters can also be set via properties.
3. Play around with the application and try other audio files like the ones defined in `/src/main/resources/*`.
4. What other parameters can be set in the `SpeechModel`?
5. Check the documentation about TTS <https://platform.openai.com/docs/models>
