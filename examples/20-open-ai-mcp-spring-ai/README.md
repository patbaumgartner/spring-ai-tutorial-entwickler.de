# Calling OpenAI from Spring AI

## Exploring Spring AI MCP Examples

1. The Spring AI MCP examples show how to integrate AI models into Java applications using Spring Boot.
2. All clients and servers communicate through the Model Configuration Protocol (MCP).
3. The `mcp-client-weather-stdio` and `mcp-client-weather-sse` demonstrate different ways to stream data: STDIO and SSE.
4. The `mcp-client-weather-node` shows how to use a Node.js-based AI model inside a Spring Boot app.
5. The server implementation, `mcp-server-weather`, supports both communication methods and delivers weather forecast data.
6. Run the different applications and observe how communication patterns affect integration and runtime behavior.
7. Check the sophisticated promts for the weather. How would the response look like if you would use a different or simpler prompt?
