1. Check the source files (Java, properties and POM).
2. Where is the OpenAI API key stored?
3. Run the Spring Boot application with `mvn spring-boot:run` from the terminal or directly in your IDE.
4. Check the output. 🐍
5. Activate the code that runs with the `RestClient` and run the application.
6. Check the output. 🐍

**Bonus:** Any idea who you easily create Java Classes or Records from JSON? 🤔
